# Linear-Logic-Cat-semantics
Categorical Semantics of Intuitionistic Multiplicative Linear Logic written in Isabelle/HOL.

These files constitute the project whose main goal was to formalize the Categorical Semantics of Intuitionistic Multiplicative Linear Logic (IMLL). It consists 
of step-by-step encoding of the notion of a Symmetric Monoidal Closed Category with a further verification of IMLL proof rules. 
The main feature of Isablle/HOL utilized here was "locale" environment which suits perfectly for developing algebraic theories.
